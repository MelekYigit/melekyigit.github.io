        <h2>PENETRATION TESTING</h2>
        <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A penetration test, also known as a pen test, is a simulated
            cyberattack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities.
            In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to
            augment a web application firewall (WAF). Pen testing can involve the attempted breaching
            of any number of application systems, (e.g., application protocol interfaces (APIs),
            frontend/backend servers) to uncover vulnerabilities, such as unsanitized inputs that are
            susceptible to code injection attacks. Insights provided by the penetration test can
            be used to fine-tune your WAF security policies and patch detected vulnerabilities.</p>

    <h2>ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
    <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled
        robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to
        the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such
        as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the
        development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be
        programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical
        theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer
        processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility
        over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs
        have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific
        tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as
        medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.</p>

    <h2>E-COMMERCE</h2>
    <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-commerce (electronic commerce or EC) is the buying and selling of goods and
        services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the internet.
        These business transactions occur either as business-to-business, business-to-consumer, consumer-to-consumer
        or consumer-to-business. The terms e-commerce and e-business are often used interchangeably. The term e-tail
        is also sometimes used in reference to transactional processes for online shopping.</p>
