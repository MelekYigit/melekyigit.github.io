        "The shortage of skilled and qualified cybersecurity professionals is one of the biggest issues facing our Internet-connected world today. RIT is helping to close this gap as a leader in computing security education. Professionals who gain the skills and tactics needed to defend against the next generation of security threats will be better prepared for careers at IBM and other organizations in the cybersecurity industry."
        â€” Bob Kalka , CRISC, Vice President, IBM Security Business Unit

        Cyber attackers
        unit  investment  automation  technology  to  launch  strikes,  whereas  many  organisations  unit  still
        victimisation manual efforts to mixture internal security findings and contextualising them with external threat data.
        Victimisation  these  ancient  ways  that,  it'
        ll  take  weeks  or  months  to  sight  intrusions,  throughout  that  amount
        attackers  can  exploit  vulnerabilities  to  compromise  systems  and  extract  info.

    To  wear  down  these  challenges,
        progressive  organisations  unit  exploring  the  employment  of  AI  (AI)  in  their  reg

    <p>The speed of processes and conjointly the amount of data to be used in defensive the cyberspace can't be
        handled by humans whereas not sizeable automation. However, it's hard to develop code with customarily mounted
        a lgorithms (hardwired logic on deciding level) for effectively defensive against the dynamically evolving attacks in
        networks.  this  instance  is  also  handled  by  applying  methods  of  computing  that  supply  flexibility  and  learning
        capability  to code. it   has
        become    obvious    that  many    cyber    security  problems  is  also   resolved    with   success
        solely  strategies    of    AI  area  unit  obtaining    used.  for  example,    wide  data    usage    is  vital    in    deciding,    and

    <p>     As the Internet of Things (IoT) is em
        erging as an attractive paradigm, a typical
        IoT architecture that U2IoT (Unit IoT
        and  Ubiquitous  IoT)  model  has  been  presented  for  the  future  IoT.  Based  on  the  U2IoT  model,  this  paper  proposes  a
        cyber-physical-social  based  security  arch
        itecture  (IPM)  to  deal  with  Informati
        on,  Physical,  and  Management  security
        perspectives, and presents how
        the architectural abstractions support U2IoT m
        odel. In particular, <p>1) an information se-
        curity model is established to describe the mapping relations
        among U2IoT, security layer,
        and security requirement, in
        which  social  layer  and  additional  intelligence  and  compatibility  properties  are  infused  into  IP

     3)  recommended security strategies are suggested for social management control.</p>

    <p>The proposed IPM combining the cyber world,
        physical world and human social provides constructive proposal towards the future IoT security and privacy protection.
